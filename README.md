# Pathfinder Tools
I'm working on building some tools to make my Pathfinder player and GM experience a little more convenient. This is still in very early phases and is nowhere near properly functional yet. Use at your own discretion, although I'm certainly open to feedback for roadmap targets and/or collaboration if you have ideas.

Whiteboard roadmap ideas:

 - Loot list - sort your plunder into categories and total weights / sale values
 - DC Calculator - plug in your character stats, get calculated spell DCs
